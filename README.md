The I Lost My Job To Corona Virus Project

The coronavirus pandemic has changed the life of every human being on this planet.

As health care workers, scientists, politicians, and governments fight on the front lines there is a second front building in this battle. Its impact on the world will be even more drastic.

Millions across the globe have lost their jobs. Whole industries are collapsing. The world economy is facing a crisis unlike any experienced in modern history.

In these times we yearn for community. Human beings joined by shared experience, shared challenges, even shared tragedy. Knowing that we do not face these challenges alone can provide immense comfort in troubled times and ultimately give us the strength to persevere.
