<p>Forming a relationship with a mentor can provide you with many advantages. They can help connect you with other individuals in your industry, offer their skills and expertise, and provide you with unbiased and open-minded advice. Here are 5 steps on how to find and cultivate your mentor relationship.</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">1) Find Someone You Admire</h3>
<p>Whether it be a former teacher or someone you worked with in the past, this individual should be someone older and more experienced than you. Search for someone who possesses similar strengths and skills to your own, as well as some that you hope to emulate.</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">2) Set Goals & Identify What You Want to Accomplish</h3>
<p>Figure out why a mentor is necessary for you; perhaps you feel as if something is missing and you’d like to fill some of those gaps with a mentor’s guidance.</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">3) Make the “Ask.”</h3>
<p>Begin by asking your potential mentor for an informal initial meeting, such as grabbing coffee. At the meeting, let the conversation flow casually as if you were meeting a friend, but make sure to describe what advice or guidance you are seeking and for what purpose. Explain how/why you value their expertise and what you expect to gain from mentorship. When the timing feels right, ask for their support through mentorship!</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">4) Be Proactive</h3>
<p>Ask your mentor for feedback and advice without waiting for them to make the first move. It’s your responsibility to initiate conversations and meetings with your mentor. This might feel strange at first, but as your relationship progresses, this will become more natural.</p>

<h3 class="uppercase">5) Pass it Forward</h3>
<p>Be a mentor to somebody else. As you will see from your own mentorship experience, creating a relationship with someone who can provide guidance, motivation, and support is a useful tool. If having a mentor was beneficial to you, consider passing it forward--  helping someone else explore careers, set goals, and strengthen skills.</p>
