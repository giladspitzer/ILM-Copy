<p>In the past couple of months, thousands around the world have lost their jobs due to Coronavirus. Some might feel helpless, as if the situation is out of their control and the only thing to do is wait until the world rebuilds. However, now more than ever, networking has become even more important during this period of uncertainty. Here are some ideas on how to network effectively during such unprecedented times.</p>

<p>Whether you have just been laid off, furloughed, fired or are still working from home, remaining connected to people in your network may be challenging. Firstly, think about your networking goals and how you can accomplish them virtually. Perhaps there is an individual who has experience in your industry that would be willing to have a Zoom meeting with you to discuss how you can excel. You can also reach out to friends and family for guidance. Times are tough lately and who better to lean on for support and advice than your friends and family? Keeping in touch with important contacts by sending a simple text asking them how they are doing is another way to stay in the know. This is a good way to show these individuals that you are still committed and are putting in effort to stay in touch. It might be beneficial to create reminders for yourself to check in once a month to talk about non-professional matters; these check-ins are what builds real relationships! At the end of the day, we are all human beings no matter how noble our job may be.</p>

<p>Another way you can network is by researching different online networking events that are happening in your area, such as a webinar that discusses tips on how to strengthen skills, or community forums that you can log into. Browsing your LinkedIn page and keeping your profile up to date to let people know what you are up to is another valuable way to stay in the loop. <a href="{{ url_for('main.resources') }}">(Check out this link to the ILMJTCV resources page!)</a></p>

<p>Remember, the largest community of people in the world is currently unemployed and everyone is going about networking virtually for the first time in history. Donâ€™t be afraid to make the first step, reach out to people, and leverage your own network.</p>
