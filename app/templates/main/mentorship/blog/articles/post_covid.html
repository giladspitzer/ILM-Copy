<p style="margin-top: 10px">The Coronavirus pandemic has created and will continue to create a lasting impression on the future of the workplace. For some, working from home has been a difficult adjustment and for others, working from home has been more enjoyable than going into an office. In the coming months, people will begin asking themselves, “is there any good reason that we should do this in person, or can we do it online?” Perhaps there may not be any good reason to do things in person, resulting in a virtual workplace that may feel isolating at times, but is safer and has the potential to be successful. While some industries may return to working in person, it’s important to remember that the workplace environment will not be the same as it once was. Employees will have to adjust to the new normal of walking around donning a mask and gloves, refraining from shaking hands, and being extra careful to social distance. The workplace will never be the same, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. As we look towards life after Coronavirus, the workforce is going to change and we will see more flexibility as well as advantages that will make these changes easier to adapt to. With the advancement of technology, the future of the workplace has many more options. Meetings that people thought needed to be in person now have the ability to take place on a simple and quick zoom call. Moreover, now that people have seen what a virtual workplace entails, some might prefer working from home as opposed to going into the office. As a result, people will save rent on office space as well as commuting costs to and from the office.</p>

<p>If your job transitions to virtual, don’t stress! As time goes on, you will adjust to your new virtual workplace and figure out a healthy balance between your work life and your personal life. This adjustment can be positive and have advantages that you didn’t even know you needed before ever working virtually from home, such as spending more time with your family and finding more efficient ways to get your work done. If your job returns to taking place in person, don’t be afraid of change! It might take some time to readjust and reassess how you go about your day in the office with these new regulations, but soon enough you will feel as if you have never even left.</p>

<p>It can be hard at times not to feel overwhelmed and anxious during such difficult times, but it’s important to take care of your mental health. Make sure to stay positive, focus on the small things that make you happy, and never stop having hope.</p>
