<p>The advance preparation for a job interview is one of the most important components of how a candidate will present themself in the interview chair. Often, this can be both stressful and intimidating as the mounting anticipation leading up to the important day grows more intense. To help you get prepared, we have compiled 10 useful tips that are sure to help the interview process run smoothly.</p>

<h3>Step 1: RESEARCH</h3>
<p>Gathering research about the company for which you are interviewing is crucial for a successful outcome. The more information you have about the company, as well as the position you are applying for, the better equipped will be to explain how your skills and past experiences may add value to the company. This preparation will enable you to feel more comfortable and at ease while being questioned, and will also give you an opportunity to showcase your skills to your advantage. Such research should include a thorough review of the company’s website or a Google search of the company’s past and current events. You want to make sure you fully understand the company’s platform and show the interviewer that you have come prepared.</p>
<h3>Step 2: NETWORK</h3>
<p>Use your personal connections to get some more information about the company you are interviewing for! Check your LinkedIn page to see if you have any connections with college alumni or other individuals who work at the company. If you know someone who works there or has worked there in the past, perhaps they might be willing to put you in touch with a current or former employee. These connections can be very helpful prior to your interview, especially if  your contact is able to give you tips about what’s important to discuss or even avoid mentioning during your interview.</p>

<h3>Step 3: KNOW YOUR RESUME</h3>
<p>Making sure that you are familiar with your resume is perhaps the most vital component of preparing for an interview. The ability to discuss your past experiences effortlessly and comfortably begins with being confident about your background. Take some time before your interview to sit down and analyze your resume so that when the interviewer asks you about your background, you are well prepared and can respond with ease.</p>

<h3>Step 4: PRACTICE/PREPARE</h3>
<p>We have all heard the commonly used phrase that ‘practice makes perfect.’ When it comes to the interview process, this phrase is right on target. Organizing practice interviews with a family member or friend will help make you more comfortable talking about yourself, and their feedback may help you improve your responses. Perhaps record yourself speaking during these practice interviews so that you can get a sense of your body language and see how/where you can do better. It is also important to prepare answers to some commonly asked interview questions, as well as questions that you might ask the interviewer. Having an idea of what your responses might be to commonly asked questions will help make sure you won’t struggle to come up with answers on the spot. The more you practice, the more confident and natural you will feel.</p>

<h3>Step 5: DRESS FOR SUCCESS/WHAT TO BRING</h3>
<p style="padding-bottom: 0">Your first impression on the day of your interview is very important. How you look and carry yourself is the first thing your interviewer will notice! Therefore, you want to make sure that you are dressed professionally and appropriately depending on where you are going for your interview. For business interviews, men should dress in a sharp suit and tie and women should dress in either a dress with a blazer or suit pants with a blouse. Since you don’t want to be late to your interview, it might be helpful to choose what you will be wearing the night before to save some time the next morning. Remember to bring an extra copy of your resume, a notepad and pen, and have some questions written down to ask the interviewer. Of course, make sure you turn off, and put away your phone before walking into the office!</p>

<h3>Step 6: BE PUNCTUAL</h3>
<p>Being on time for your interview is not only extremely important, but says something about who you are as a person. You do not want to make the interviewer wait for you, especially since you want to make a good first impression! This usually means you should aim to arrive at least 10-15 minutes prior to the time you are expected to be there. Spend some time the night before determining how much time it will take to arrive at the office, and take into account traffic, transportation, parking, etc.  Make sure to get a good night’s sleep!</p>

<h3>Step 7: STAY CALM</h3>
<p>It is absolutely normal to be nervous before your interview! Try to take some deep breaths and remind yourself that you will do the best you can and you are prepared! If you become nervous during the interview, take a moment to gather your thoughts to put yourself back on track. If you are unsure what is being asked, don’t be afraid to ask for clarification to better structure your responses.</p>

<h3>Step 8: INTERVIEW ETIQUETTE</h3>
<p>Proper etiquette goes hand-in-hand with a first impression. Make sure to keep these  things in mind. Firstly, remember to greet the receptionist, the interviewer, and anyone else you meet at the office with a friendly, polite, and enthusiastic demeanor. During the interview, remember to introduce yourself with a firm handshake, be aware of your body language, and make eye contact with your interviewer while speaking. Pay attention while the interviewer speaks to you, and try to look and be interested throughout the entire meeting.</p>

<h3>Step 9: OBSERVE CULTURE</h3>
<p>Just like recruiters and interviewers meet with you to decide if you will be a good fit for their company, you should be doing the same. Pay attention to the way your interviewer conducts his/her interview. Are they prepared? Are they dragging it out or moving through it quickly? How do they represent the company? These are things you want to keep in mind during your interview so that you, just like they, can decide if the company is a good fit for you.</p>

<h3>Step 10: FOLLOW UP</h3>
<p>Following up after your job interview with a thank you note or email is the perfect opportunity for you to show your interviewer how interested you are in the position and also to showcase your writing skills in a small way. It gives you the chance to reiterate why you want the job and remind the interviewer how you might make valuable contributions to their company.</p>
