      <p style="padding: 5px 10px">Life is crazy right now in 2020. I got one too many calls from incredibly smart, talented people saying "I've been furloughed". I decided I wanted to do something about it, and here we are! By day, I am a business development director at a global professional services firm. By night, I also have a website/podcast called Awkward Networker where I help people build their personal/professional networks. Not much handshaking happening right now, so I'm building this out instead. Stay positive. Do good.</p>
