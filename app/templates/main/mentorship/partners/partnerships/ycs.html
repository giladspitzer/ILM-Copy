            <h3>About</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">The Career Strategy Series consists of 3 immersive 3-hour workshops spread over 3 weeks (October 10, 17, and 24) supplemented by pre-work and assignments between sessions designed to facilitate the process of self-actualization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-size: 15px">The 1st session will help you build confidence in what you have to offer employers by leveraging a strength-based approach rooted in positive psychology and personal narrative. Expect to share some of the greatest experiences of your life and have them well received by the smiling faces of your small group.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 15px">The 2nd session will create the space for 360-degree feedback to validate your strengths while building lasting bonds with your community of peers. By the end of this session, you will have all the tools to reimagine a holistic vision for the next ten years of your life, and perhaps even further out.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 15px">The 3rd session will teach you a practical way to make the jump from your self-assessment results to analyzing your job and career options for further research. By the end of the session, you will know how to develop a targeted (sniper) approach to your job search using a clearly focused and strategic Job Search Action Plan.</p></li>

            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">Between sessions, you will be holding yourself accountable to the weekly action plans and you will have the added support of your online community and your coaches via Slack to help you push towards achieving clarity for the next step of your career.</p>
